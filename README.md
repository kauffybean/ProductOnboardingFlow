# Assembli Estimator Onboarding Platform

**Interactive onboarding prototype for a construction estimating platform. Case study turned working demo to show how real UX beats static mockups.**

## Why I Built This

This was part of a case study for a senior PM role at a construction tech startup. The ask was simple: mock up a UI to collect missing inputs their AI couldn't pull from blueprints or settings.

Instead of tossing together a static flow, I rebuilt their entire onboarding experience in Replit using modern tools. The engineers were pretty blown away. They were still new to tools like Cursor and V0, so I figured the best way to communicate vision was to build something real.

The app doesnâ€™t calculate estimates (their job, not mine), but the UI is fully functional and shows how a cleaner, more intuitive workflow could work in practice. I ended up passing on the role due to comp and team fit, but it was a fun exercise. Just wanted to show that good product thinking isn't about pixels or decks. It's about showing, not telling.
